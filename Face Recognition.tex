%\emph{Find a statistical method which uses only Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) best track typhoon data during or before year $n$ to hind-cast the entire best track of all typhoons in years $n+1$.   Given only the latter typhoons' initial three best track points (i.e. at $t=0,6,$ and $12$ hours), the maximum position error at each hind-casted track point must be less than 500 km. The method must work for the three most recent years of published best track data.}

\section{Face Recognition}
Face recognition is a type of object recognition, which is a subfield of image recognition (Figure \ref{fig1}). Face recognition itself may be classified by the methods employed (Table \ref{tab1}).
